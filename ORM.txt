ORM == OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING
=====================================
A technique for converting data between Java objects and relational databases. 
ORM converts data between two incompatible type systems (Java and MySQL), 
Each model class becomes a table in database and each instance a row of the table.
While mapping we have to consider the data, type of data and its relations with its self-entity or entity in any other table.

we need 2 components
API , OBJECT RELATIOAL MAPPER

API - JPA - JAVA PERSISTENCE API -it uses data layers

features of ORM
1. provides high level API
2.It is highly stable and eminent. Used by many industrial programmers.
3.Help to write persistence classes using object oriented classes. Uses meta data format for mapping 
4.It has many fetching techniques and hopeful locking techniques.
5. support for mapping complex domain object model


ORM architecture.
===========================
Object Relational Mapping

3 PHASES

Phase1 - OBJECT DATA PHASE
-------------------------------
This contains POJO classes, service interfaces and classes. 
It is the main business component layer, which has business logic operations and attributes.

POJO clasess
DAO/service classess

Phase 2 -MAPPPING OR PERSISTAENCE PHASE
--------------------------------------------
This contains JPA provider, mapping file (ORM.xml), JPA Loader, and Object Grid.

JPA Provider : The vendor product which contains JPA flavor (javax.persistence). For example Eclipselink, Toplink, Hibernate, etc.

Mapping file : The mapping file (ORM.xml) contains mapping configuration between the data in a POJO class and data in a relational database.

JPA Loader : 	The JPA loader works like cache memory, which can load the relational grid data.
		 It works like a copy of database to interact with service classes for POJO data (Attributes of POJO class).

Object Grid : The Object grid is a temporary location which can store the copy of relational data, i.e. like a cache memory. 
		All queries against the database is first effected on the data in the object grid. Only after it is committed, it effects the main database.

Phase 3 - RELATIONAL DATA PHASE
---------------------
It contains the relational data which is logically connected to the business component. 
only when the business component commit the data, it is stored into the database physically. 
Until then the modified data is stored in a cache memory as a grid format. Same is the process for obtaining data.


The mechanism of the programmatic interaction of above three phases is called as object relational mapping.
